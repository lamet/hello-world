Get to know github using this guide.
A repository is used to organize a single project and can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets etc.

Branching enables working on different versions of a repository at one time. By default, a repository has one branch named master, the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
When you create a branch off the master branch, you're making a copy or snapshot of master as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
